# Work Summary Generator - System Blueprint

## Overview
A Google Apps Script-based performance analysis system that transforms email and calendar activities into executive-ready performance summaries. The system groups activities into meaningful projects, analyzes contribution types, detects leadership behaviors, and generates professional reports suitable for performance reviews and career development.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Collection Engine
- **Gmail Integration**: Fetches sent emails using search queries with date filtering
- **Calendar Integration**: Retrieves calendar events with attendee and duration analysis
- **Activity Filtering**: Excludes automated emails and short meetings
- **Data Normalization**: Standardizes activity objects with consistent schema

#### 2. Fuzzy Matching System
- **Stem Matching**: Partial word matching for variations (e.g., "innovat" matches "innovation", "innovative")
- **Exact Matching**: Word boundary detection using regex patterns
- **Pattern Matching**: Multi-word phrase detection with flexible ordering
- **Outcome Detection**: Business impact keyword identification with multipliers

#### 3. Project Grouping Intelligence
- **Activity Clustering**: Groups related activities based on keyword similarity
- **Impact Scoring**: Calculates weighted scores using category keywords and outcome multipliers
- **Relationship Analysis**: Links activities through common meaningful terms
- **Priority Ranking**: Sorts projects by total impact score

#### 4. Leadership Analysis Engine
- **Contribution Type Detection**: Identifies Led/Drove/Collaborated/Contributed patterns
- **Team Coverage Analysis**: Detects coverage behaviors with 2.5x multiplier
- **Organizational Thinking**: Identifies strategic perspective with enhanced weighting
- **People Impact Tracking**: Measures scope of influence through meeting attendees

#### 5. Report Generation System
- **Executive Summary**: Key achievements with business impact
- **Performance Metrics**: Clean ratings across four core values
- **Project Narratives**: Cohesive stories of contribution and outcomes
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Growth-focused career guidance

                                            ↓
Project Grouping ← Impact Calculation ← Outcome Multipliers
        ↓
Contribution Analysis → Leadership Detection → Business Outcome Mapping
        ↓
Performance Metrics ← Executive Summary ← Project Narratives
        ↓
Google Doc Report → Email Notification → Job Status Tracking
```

## Configuration System

### Keyword Taxonomy
```
INNOVATION:
- stems: ['innovat', 'creat', 'design', 'prototype', 'pilot']
- exact: ['mvp', 'r&d', 'poc', 'beta', 'alpha']
- patterns: ['proof of concept', 'minimum viable', 'design thinking']

EXECUTION:
- stems: ['deliver', 'ship', 'launch', 'complet', 'implement']
- exact: ['go-live', 'rollout', 'milestone', 'deadline', 'kpi']
- patterns: ['project completion', 'goal completion', 'went live']

COLLABORATION:
- stems: ['collaborat', 'partner', 'coordinat', 'align', 'sync']
- exact: ['cross-functional', 'stakeholder', 'workshop']
- patterns: ['working with', 'team effort', 'group effort']

LEADERSHIP:
- stems: ['lead', 'mentor', 'coach', 'guid', 'direct', 'manag']
- exact: ['1:1', 'one-on-one', 'feedback', 'delegation', 'vision']
- patterns: ['decision making', 'strategic direction', 'team development']
```

### Outcome Multipliers
```
Revenue Impact: 2.5x multiplier
Customer Satisfaction: 2.0x multiplier  
Operational Efficiency: 1.8x multiplier
Market Position: 2.2x multiplier
```

### Leadership Weighting
```
Senior Leader (Coverage + Org Thinking): 2.5x
Team Lead (Coverage OR Org Thinking + People): 1.8x
Mentor/Guide (People Development): 1.3x
Individual Contributor: 1.0x
```

## Scoring Algorithm

### Base Scoring
- Base Score: 20 points (all activities)
- Stem Match: +10 points each
- Exact Match: +15 points each
- Pattern Match: +20 points each
- Collaboration Bonus: +15 points (multi-person activities)

### Outcome Enhancement
- Base Outcome Bonus: +25 points
- Multiplier Application: Score × highest outcome multiplier
- Multi-Outcome Bonus: +15 points per additional outcome
- Maximum Score Cap: 100 points

### Project Impact Calculation
```javascript
projectImpact = sum(activityScores) × leadershipWeight × outcomeMultiplier
```

## User Interface Flow

### 1. Homepage Card
- Active job status display
- New report creation button
- Job detail navigation

### 2. Configuration Card
- Personal information input
- Date range selection
- Role profile selection (IC/Manager/Executive)

### 3. Job Status Cards
- Real-time progress updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Report access and dismissal

### 4. Background Processing
- Asynchronous job execution
- Status persistence across sessions
- Automated cleanup and notifications

## Report Structure

### Executive Summary
- Strategic alignment score (0-4.0)
- Top 3 key achievements with impact categories
- Business outcome highlights

### Performance Metrics
- Innovation: Rating + Impact Score + Key Contributions
- Execution: Rating + Impact Score + Key Contributions  
- Collaboration: Rating + Impact Score + Key Contributions
- Leadership: Rating + Impact Score + Key Contributions

### Project Contributions
For each major project:
- Duration and impact score
- Leadership role and collaboration scope
- Narrative summary of contribution
- Business outcomes (Customer/Business/Operational)

### Strategic Recommendations
- Strength areas to leverage
- Growth opportunities to pursue
- Portfolio balance guidance
- Leadership development suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Google Apps Script Compatibility
- Uses `var` declarations (no `const`/`let`)
- String concatenation instead of template literals
- Traditional `for` loops instead of array methods
- Regular function syntax (no arrow functions)
- Manual object property copying (no spread operator)

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all major operations
- Detailed error logging with context information
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- User-friendly error notifications with recovery guidance

### Performance Optimizations
- Limited Gmail search results (200 threads max)
- Activity filtering to remove low-value items
- Efficient project grouping algorithms
- Minimal document generation operations

### Data Persistence
- PropertiesService for job state management
- JSON serialization for complex objects
- Automatic cleanup of old job data
- Status tracking across multiple sessions

## Deployment Requirements

### Required APIs and Permissions
```
Gmail API: gmail.readonly
Calendar API: calendar.readonly
Drive API: drive.file
Documents API: documents
Script API: script.scriptapp
```

### Setup Steps
1. Enable required Google APIs in Apps Script project
2. Configure OAuth scopes in appsscript.json
3. Deploy as Gmail add-on
4. Test with small date ranges initially
5. Monitor execution logs for errors

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular cleanup of old job data (7+ days)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Keyword taxonomy updates based on usage patterns
- User feedback integration for accuracy improvements

## Usage Guidelines

### Optimal Date Ranges
- Start with 1-2 weeks for testing
- Monthly analysis for regular reviews
- Quarterly analysis for comprehensive summaries
- Avoid periods longer than 3 months to prevent timeouts

### Expected Processing Times
- 1 week of data: 30-60 seconds
- 1 month of data: 2-5 minutes
- 3 months of data: 5-15 minutes

### Quality Indicators
- Projects identified: 3-8 for monthly analysis
- Strategic alignment: 2.5+ indicates good role fit
- High-impact activities: 30%+ shows strategic focus
- Leadership evidence: Essential for advancement readiness
