1. Fuzzy Matching Implementation
Three Types of Matching:

Stem matching: Finds word roots (e.g., "innovat" matches "innovation", "innovative", "innovating")
Exact matching: Word boundary matching (e.g., "mvp" as whole word, not within "improvement")
Pattern matching: Phrase matching with flexibility (e.g., "cost savings" finds activities mentioning both "cost" and "savings")

Scoring Values:

Stem matches: +10 points (more flexible, lower value)
Exact matches: +15 points (precise terms)
Pattern matches: +20 points (complex phrases)

2. Realistic Thresholds
New Rating Scale:

4.0 (Excellent): 70+ points (was 80+)
3.0 (Good): 50-69 points (was 65-79)
2.0 (Fair): 30-49 points (was 45-64)
1.0 (Poor): 15-29 points (was 1-44)
0.5 (Minimal): Under 15 points

Base Score Increased: From 10 to 20 points, recognizing that all work activities have some value.
3. Multi-Labeling System
How it works:

Each activity gets scored against ALL four categories
Activities with scores ‚â•30 in multiple categories get assigned to multiple labels
Example: "Led brainstorming session with 5 stakeholders to design new customer onboarding process"

Innovation: 75 points (brainstorming, design, new)
Collaboration: 65 points (session with stakeholders)
Leadership: 55 points (led the session)
Gets labeled as all three categories



Benefits:

More accurate representation of complex work
Higher total activity counts (but metrics adjust for this)
Better recognition of integrated strategic work

4. Outcome Tracking & Weighting
Outcome Categories with Multipliers:

Revenue (2.5x multiplier): Sales, deals, monetization, cost savings
Customer Satisfaction (2.0x multiplier): NPS, retention, user experience
Efficiency (1.8x multiplier): Process improvement, automation, speed
Market Position (2.2x multiplier): Competitive advantage, growth, brand

How Outcome Scoring Works:

Base category score calculated normally (20-100 points)
System scans for outcome keywords
If outcome keywords found:

Apply highest relevant multiplier to category score
Add base outcome bonus (+25 points)
Add multi-outcome bonus (+15 per additional outcome)


Cap final score at 100

Example:

Activity: "Delivered new pricing model that increased customer retention by 15%"
Base Execution score: 45 points
Outcome detection: Revenue + Customer Satisfaction
Final score: (45 √ó 2.5) + 25 + 15 = 152 ‚Üí capped at 100
Gets labeled as high-impact execution with strong business outcomes

Expected Impact on Your Results
With your previous scores:

Innovation: 30.0 average ‚Üí likely 45-60 (Fair to Good range)
Execution: 33.6 average ‚Üí likely 50-70 (Good range)
Collaboration: 34.3 average ‚Üí likely 55-75 (Good to Excellent range)
Leadership: 25.7 average ‚Üí likely 40-55 (Fair to Good range)

The fuzzy matching should capture more workplace language, realistic thresholds should give better ratings, multi-labeling should show integrated work value, and outcome tracking should elevate business-impact activities to their proper recognition level.
